### Example Implementation:

To provide an example implementation of a perceptron model in Python using TensorFlow and Keras, you could follow these steps:

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
    ```

2. **Import Libraries and Define Perceptron Model**:
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    import tensorflow as tf
    from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
    from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

    # Load and preprocess data (example for binary classification)
    X_train = ...  # Training features
    y_train = ...  # Training labels
    ```

3. **Build the Perceptron Model**:
    ```python
    model = Sequential([
        Dense(1, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],), activation='sigmoid')
    ])
    
    # Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    ```

4. **Train the Model**:
    ```python
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32)
    ```

5. **Evaluate and Test the Model**:
    ```python
    X_test = ...  # Testing features
    y_test = ...  # Testing labels

    loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
    print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy}")
    ```

    # Example usage with a generator (assuming you have image data)
    datagen.fit(X_train)
    
    model = Sequential([
        Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(150, 150, 3)),
