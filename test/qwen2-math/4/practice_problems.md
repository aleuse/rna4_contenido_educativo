Problem 1:
Title: Applying Bioinspired Optimization
Description: Solve for \( x \) in the following non-linear equation using an bioinspired method (e.g., Genetic Algorithm):
\[ f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + x - 4 \]
Solution:

Step 1: Define the objective function as \( f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + x - 4 \).
Step 2: Choose an initial population of potential solutions (e.g., random values between -5 and 5, consisting of 10 elements).
Step 3: Evaluate each solution using the objective function.
Step 4: Select the top 5% of solutions based on their fitness scores.
Step 5: Generate new solutions through crossover and mutation operations.
Step 6: Repeat steps 2-5 for a specified number of generations or until convergence is achieved.
Step 7: Identify the solution with the minimum value of \( f(x) \) as the optimal solution.

Problem 2:
Title: Neuronal Network for Time Series Forecasting
Description: Given a time series dataset representing monthly sales (in thousands of dollars) over the last 10 years, use a neural network to forecast the next year's sales. The dataset is provided in an Excel file.
Solution:

Step 1: Load and preprocess the dataset from the Excel file.
Step 2: Split the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% for training and 20% for testing).
Step 3: Normalize the data to ensure that all values are between 0 and 1.
Step 4: Define the architecture of the neural network, including the number of input nodes, hidden layers, output nodes, activation functions, and optimizers.
Step 5: Train the neural network using the training dataset for a specified number of epochs or until convergence is achieved.
Step 6: Evaluate the performance of the model on the testing dataset by calculating relevant metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
Step 7: Use the trained model to forecast the next year's sales based on the historical data.

Problem 3:
Title: Bioinspired System Design for Optimization
Description: Design a bioinspired system to solve an optimization problem of your choice. Explain how the system is inspired by nature and what specific bioinspired techniques are used.
Solution:

Step 1: Identify a real-world optimization problem (e.g., optimizing the layout of solar panels on a roof).
Step 2: Choose a bioinspired technique based on natural phenomena or processes (e.g., Ant Colony Optimization, Firefly Algorithm, or bee colony optimization).
Step 3: Define the fitness function that quantifies the quality of a solution.
Step 4: Implement the chosen bioinspired technique to find an optimal or near-optimal solution. This may involve defining parameters such as population size, number of iterations, and probability values.
Step 5: Test the system using different scenarios or initial conditions to evaluate its robustness and efficiency.
Step 6: Analyze the results obtained from the optimization process, comparing them with other techniques or known solutions.

Problem 4:
Title: Deep Learning for Image Classification
Description: Given a dataset of images (e.g., cats vs. dogs), use deep learning to classify images into two categories. The dataset is provided in a format of your choice.
Solution:

Step 1: Load and preprocess the image dataset, ensuring that all images are scaled to the same dimensions and converted to a suitable color space.
Step 2: Split the data into training, validation, and testing sets (e.g., 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing).
Step 3: Define the architecture of the deep learning model, including the type of neural network (e.g., Convolutional Neural Network), number of layers, filters, and activation functions.
Step 4: Train the model using the training dataset with an appropriate loss function (e.g., categorical cross-entropy) and optimizer (e.g., Adam).
Step 5: Evaluate the performance of the model on the validation set by calculating relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Step 6:Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search to improve its performance.
Step 7: Test the final model on the testing set to assess its generalization capabilities.
