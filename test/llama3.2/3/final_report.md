# Class Notes
=============

### Introduction to Machine Learning
-----------------------------------

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves training algorithms on data to make predictions or decisions. The goal of machine learning is to enable computers to learn from experience without being explicitly programmed.

* **Supervised Learning:** The algorithm is trained on labeled data and learns to map inputs to outputs.
* **Unsupervised Learning:** The algorithm is trained on unlabeled data and learns to identify patterns or structure.
* **Reinforcement Learning:** The algorithm learns through trial and error by interacting with an environment.

### Deep Learning
-----------------

Deep learning is a type of machine learning that involves the use of neural networks with multiple layers. These networks are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.

* **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Used for image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.
* **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** Used for time series forecasting, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
* **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks:** A type of RNN used for sequence modeling.

### Neural Networks
-----------------

Neural networks are a fundamental component of deep learning. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process inputs and produce outputs.

* **Activation Functions:** Used to introduce non-linearity into the model, such as ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh.
* **Backpropagation:** An algorithm used to optimize the weights and biases of the network during training.

### Practice Problems
--------------------

1. Implement a linear regression model using scikit-learn to predict house prices based on features such as number of bedrooms and square footage.
2. Train a CNN on the CIFAR-10 dataset to classify images into one of ten categories.
3. Use an RNN to forecast future values in a time series dataset.

### Discussion Questions
----------------------

1. What are some common challenges associated with machine learning, and how can they be addressed?
2. How does deep learning differ from traditional machine learning approaches?
3. What are some potential applications of neural networks in real-world problems?
