#### Teaching Style
The instructor appears to employ an **applied**, theoretical approach, focusing on practical applications of bio-inspired systems, optimization methods, and neural networks. The course content is structured around specific topics, with an emphasis on understanding the underlying concepts and applying them to real-world problems.

#### Instructor Preferences
The instructor seems to prefer a **disciplinary** structure, organizing the content into distinct modules or chapters (e.g., "Conocimientos Específicos," "Optimización con métodos bioinspirados"). This suggests an emphasis on developing specialized knowledge in specific areas. Additionally, the instructor's use of detailed programmatic specifications ("Programa detallado") implies a focus on precise instruction and clear expectations.

#### Primary Language
The primary language used in the course appears to be **Spanish**, with technical terms and concepts presented in their original form. The instructor does not seem to provide translations or equivalent expressions in English, suggesting that proficiency in Spanish is assumed for students.
