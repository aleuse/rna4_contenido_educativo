# Class Notes on Systems Bioinspired and Neuronal

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1. Understand the principles behind systems bioinspired by natural phenomena.
2. Analyze and implement algorithms inspired by ant colonies and swarms.
3. Comprehend the fundamental concepts of artificial neural networks.
4. Evaluate the application of neural networks in various fields.
5. Compare and contrast different machine learning techniques, including evolutionary algorithms and reinforcement learning.

## Detailed Class Notes

### Systems Bioinspired
- **Evolving Algorithms**: Algorithms that mimic natural selection processes to evolve solutions. Key concepts include fitness function, mutation, crossover, and selection.
- **Ant Colonies**: Algorithms inspired by the behavior of ants, such as the Ant System for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The pheromone trail model is central to these algorithms.
- **Swarms**: Algorithms inspired by animal swarms like birds or fish. These algorithms are used for optimization problems and task allocation.
- **Enjambment**: A process where individuals in a swarm interact indirectly, leading to collective intelligence.

### Artificial Neural Networks
- **Neural Network Structure**: Layers (input, hidden, output), neurons, and connections between them.
- **Learning Algorithms**: Backpropagation, Hebbian learning, and reinforcement learning.
- **Applications**: Image recognition, natural language processing, and pattern recognition.

### Machine Learning Techniques
- **Supervised Learning**: Learning from labeled data. Techniques include linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machines (SVMs), and k-nearest neighbors (k-NN).
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Learning without labeled data. Techniques include clustering (k-means, hierarchical) and dimensionality reduction.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning by interaction with an environment to maximize a reward signal.

## Practice Problems

1. Implement the Ant System algorithm for solving the TSP.
2. Design a neural network that can classify images from the MNIST dataset.
3. Develop a reinforcement learning agent that can play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

## Discussion Questions

1. How do ant colonies solve the Traveling Salesman Problem?
2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using neural networks for image recognition compared to traditional methods?
3. Discuss the differences between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.
