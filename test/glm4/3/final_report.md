# Machine Learning and Deep Learning Class Notes

## Class Introduction
This class is an introductory course to machine learning and deep learning, covering the fundamentals of these fields, including algorithms, techniques, and their applications in real-world scenarios.

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand the basic concepts of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
2. Learn different types of machine learning algorithms (supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning).
3. Gain knowledge about neural networks and deep learning architectures.
4. Familiarize yourself with tools and libraries for machine learning development, such as TensorFlow, Keras, and scikit-learn.
5. Develop practical skills in data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Class Notes

### Machine Learning Basics
- **Machine Learning**: A subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.
- **Supervised Learning**: Algorithms learn from labeled datasets to predict outcomes (classification and regression).
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Algorithms analyze unlabeled data to find patterns and relationships within the data (clustering and dimensionality reduction).
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Agents learn to make decisions by taking actions in an environment, receiving rewards or penalties based on their actions.

### Neural Networks
- **Neural Network**: A computational model inspired by the human brain that can recognize patterns and classify data.
- **Layers**: Composed of neurons arranged in layers: input, hidden, and output.
- **Weights and Biases**: Parameters that define the strength of connections between neurons and their influence on activation.

### Deep Learning
- **Deep Learning**: A subset of machine learning that involves neural networks with many layers (deep).
- **Backpropagation**: An algorithm used to train neural networks by adjusting weights and biases based on error gradients.
- **Applications**: Image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, and more.

### Tools and Libraries
- **TensorFlow**: An open-source machine learning framework developed by Google Brain.
- **Keras**: A high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.
- **scikit-learn**: A Python-based library for data mining and data analysis.

## Practice Problems

1. Implement a simple linear regression model to predict house prices using the Boston Housing dataset from scikit-learn.
2. Train a neural network to classify images of animals into cat and dog categories using the MNIST dataset.
3. Develop an unsupervised learning algorithm to perform clustering on the Iris dataset.

## Discussion Questions

1. What are the main differences between supervised learning and unsupervised learning?
2. How does the concept of backpropagation work in neural networks?
3. In what applications are deep learning models most commonly used?
