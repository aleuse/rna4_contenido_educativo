Comprehensive Class Notes and Resources

## Detailed Class Notes

### Neural Networks
- **Introduction**: Neural networks are a subset of machine learning algorithms inspired by biological neural systems, consisting of layers of interconnected neurons.
- **Structure**: Composed of an input layer, hidden layers (sometimes including multiple hidden layers), and an output layer. Each layer transforms data using weighted connections and activation functions.
- **Activation Functions**: Functions like sigmoid, ReLU, and tanh are used to introduce non-linearity in the model.
- **Loss Functions**: Commonly used include mean squared error (MSE) for regression and cross-entropy loss for classification.

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- **Architecture**: Includes convolutional layers for feature extraction and pooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions. Often followed by fully connected layers for classification.
- **Convolution Operations**: Apply filters over input data to detect patterns, reducing the need for manual features extraction.
- **Pooling Layers**: Downsample the image to capture contextual information, helping in translation invariance.

### Data Augmentation
- **Techniques**: Techniques like rotation, flipping, scaling, and cropping improve model generalization by exposing the network to varied inputs.
- **Purpose**: Increases dataset size without labeling, preventing overfitting and improving robustness.
- **Common Methods**: Random erasing, horizontal/vertical flips, and color jittering.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1. Understand the principles and components of neural networks.
2. Implement and analyze convolutional neural networks for image tasks.
3. Apply data augmentation techniques to enhance model performance.
4. Develop solutions using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## Practice Problems

### Neural Networks
1. **Forward Propagation**: Given an input vector and weights, compute the output through each layer.
2. **Loss Calculation**: Compute the loss between predicted and actual outputs using MSE or cross-entropy.
3. **Backpropagation**: Calculate gradients for weight updates based on error signals.

### Convolutional Neural Networks
1. **Filter Application**: Implement a 5x5 filter over an image to detect edges.
2. **Pool Operation**: Apply max-pooling to reduce the image size by half in each dimension.
3. **Fully Connected Layer**: Compute the output after flattening pooled outputs for classification.

### Data Augmentation
1. **Random Rotation**: Rotate an image by a random degree and adjust bounding boxes if necessary.
2. **Horizontal Flip**: Reflect an image horizontally and recompute annotations if applicable.
3. **Color Jittering**: Randomly alter pixel values within specified ranges to simulate varied conditions.
