# Course Notes

The course covers key topics including:
- Optimization inspired by biological systems 
- Neural network architectures and applications
- Deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch
- Adversarial machine learning attacks and defenses
- Transformer models for language and vision tasks
- State-of-the-art generative models like Stable Diffusion

# Learning Objectives
Students will be able to:
1. Explain the principles behind bio-inspired optimization algorithms 
2. Implement and fine-tune neural networks for classification, regression, etc.
3. Use popular deep learning frameworks to build complex AI systems  
4. Analyze and safeguard ML models against adversarial threats
5. Apply transformer architectures to sequence data problems
6. Generate realistic images using advanced generative models

# Practice Problems
1. Optimize the parameters of a genetic algorithm to solve the knapsack problem.
2. Train a convolutional neural network on CIFAR-10 and achieve 95%+ accuracy.
3. Implement an actor-critic RL agent that learns to play Atari games.
4. Defend an image classifier against adversarial examples using data augmentation.
5. Use a transformer model to predict the next word in a Shakespeare play.

# Discussion Questions
1. How do biological neural networks compare to artificial ones in terms of complexity and capabilities? 
2. What are some limitations of current deep learning frameworks and how can they be overcome?
3. Can we trust AI systems to make high-stakes decisions, or should humans always be in the loop?
4. How might generative models like Stable Diffusion change fields like art and design?
5. What's the future of AI research - more sophisticated foundations or advanced applications?
