Teaching Style:
The syllabus indicates an emphasis on theoretical knowledge as well as practical application of concepts through problem-solving exercises. The use of bio-inspired systems, neural networks, deep learning frameworks, and data applications suggests the instructor will likely employ a mix of lecture-based content delivery interwoven with guided problem-solving activities and discussions.

Preferred Structuring:
The course appears to be structured around core topics (bioinspired systems, neural networks) which are broken down into subcategories for more focused study. Each main topic is accompanied by specific objectives or skills that students should develop. This granular structuring allows the instructor to cover a wide range of material in a systematic way.

Primary Language: 
The syllabus and course content are presented entirely in Spanish, indicating this will be the primary language used throughout the instruction. 

Educational Approach:
Based on the detailed topic breakdowns and skill-based objectives, the course seems to follow both theoretical (e.g., introduction to neural networks) and applied/discussion/problem-solving approaches (e.g., applying neural networks to data tabular applications). The mix of topics suggests a blended pedagogical style that exposes students to concepts they can analyze, discuss, and practically apply.
